Simple fuel cost calculator. Input a distance, fuel price and fuel efficiency, and it will output the fuel cost.

It supports different units:
* Distance - miles and kilometres
* Fuel price - per litre, per gallon (imperial) and per gallon (US)
* Fuel efficiency - mpg (imperial), mpg (US), L/100km and km/L
* Any currency (though this is just symbolic and doesn't affect the calculations)

Mainly developed this because the existing ones I found had a tonne of ads or don't have a great UX IMO, and also because it was quite an easy programming project. :smile:

For simplicity, it currently doesn't fetch fuel prices; you have to enter the fuel price manually.
